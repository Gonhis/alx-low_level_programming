project : 0x1A-hash_tables

A hash table in C/C++ is a data structure that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute indexes for a key. You can store the value at the appropriate location based on the hash table index.

The benefit of using a hash table is its very fast access time. Typically, the time complexity (amortized time complexity) is a constant O(1) access time

Mandatory tasks :

0. >>> ht = {}
Write a function that creates a hash table.
1. djb2
Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
2. key -> index
Write a function that gives you the index of a key.
3. >>> ht['betty'] = 'cool'
Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.
4. >>> ht['betty']
Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.
5. >>> print(ht)
Write a function that prints a hash table.
6. >>> del ht
Write a function that deletes a hash table.

Advanced task :

7. $ht['Betty'] = 'Cool'
In PHP, hash tables are ordered. Waitâ€¦ WAT? How is this even possible?
Before you continue, please take a moment to think about it: how you would implement it if you were asked to during an interview or a job. What data structures would you use? How would it work?
For this task, please:
Read PHP Internals Book: HashTable
Use the same hash function
Use these data structures
Rewrite the previous functions using these data structures:
shash_table_t *shash_table_create(unsigned long int size);
int shash_table_set(shash_table_t *ht, const char *key, const char *value);
The key/value pair should be inserted in the sorted list at the right place
Note that here we do not want to do exactly like PHP: we want to create a sorted linked list, by key (sorted on ASCII value), that we can print by traversing it. See example.
char *shash_table_get(const shash_table_t *ht, const char *key);
void shash_table_print(const shash_table_t *ht);
Should print the hash table using the sorted linked list
void shash_table_print_rev(const shash_table_t *ht);
Should print the hash tables key/value pairs in reverse order using the sorted linked list
void shash_table_delete(shash_table_t *ht);
You are allowed to have more than 5 functions in your file
